/**
 * Round 3 (Signaling) + Round 4 (WebRTC Core). Owns:
 *  - the local camera/mic MediaStream,
 *  - one RTCPeerConnection per other participant (mesh — every browser
 *    talks to every other browser directly, capped at
 *    MeetingPolicyService::maxMeshParticipants(), surfaced here as
 *    `meshCapacity` from GET .../roster),
 *  - the presence-channel subscription that tells us who else is here,
 *  - and SDP offer/answer/ICE-candidate exchange over that same channel's
 *    client events (`whisper`) — never through Laravel at all, per
 *    config/webrtc.php's docblock.
 *
 * Signaling glare avoidance: whoever *joins* second is the one who
 * offers. `here()` fires once, right after we join, with everyone
 * already in the room — we offer to each of them (we're the new
 * arrival). `joining()` fires later for people who arrive after us — we
 * do NOT offer to them (they'll offer to us, since from their `here()`
 * we're an existing member). This one-directional rule means no two
 * peers ever race to send simultaneous offers to each other.
 *
 * `guestToken` is null for a signed-in participant (Bearer token on the
 * `api` client covers auth) and the guest's short-lived token
 * (MeetingLobbyService::issueGuestToken) for a guest — every REST/whisper
 * call below just threads it through, same as Round 2's lobby calls.
 *
 * Round 5 (Live Collaboration) additions — بند 7/8 (Chat, public +
 * private), بند 11 (Raise Hand + ephemeral Reactions), بند 9 (Screen
 * Sharing host policies). Chat/hand/reaction/screen-share-policy events
 * all ride the *same* presence channel this hook already joins for
 * Round 3/4 (no second subscription there) — the one addition is a
 * private per-actor "inbox" channel (personalChannelName()) for private
 * chat messages addressed to us specifically (see
 * MeetingChatService::broadcast()'s docblock for why a private message
 * never touches the public presence channel at all).
 *
 * `isHost` gates the screen-share host-policy actions client-side (the
 * buttons simply don't render for non-hosts) — the backend is the real
 * authority and re-checks role on every one of those calls regardless
 * (MeetingSignalingService::setScreenSharingLock() and friends).
 *
 * Round 6 (Host Controls) additions — بند 5 (Participants Panel:
 * mute/disable-camera/remove/promote/demote/transfer-host/lock). `myRole`
 * tracks the local actor's own role live ('host'|'co_host'|'participant'
 * — a guest is never a manager, so it's never 'guest' here), seeded from
 * the `isHost` prop and kept current by the `.participant.role_changed`/
 * `.meeting.host_transferred` listeners below whenever *we* are the
 * target (promoted/demoted/handed the host role by someone else — the
 * same events patch other participants' `role` field in the
 * `participants` map when *they're* the target instead). `isManager`
 * (host or co-host) mirrors MeetingPolicyService::canManage() exactly —
 * gates mute/disable-camera/remove(non-co-host)/lock; the stricter
 * primary-host-only actions (remove a co-host, promote, demote, transfer
 * host) are gated with `myRole === 'host'` directly at the call site
 * instead, same asymmetry as MeetingHostControlService's own
 * requireManager()-vs-requirePrimaryHost() split. As with the screen-
 * share policies, the backend re-checks all of this regardless — these
 * are UI affordances only.
 *
 * Round 7 (Collaboration Extras) additions — بند 19 (File Sharing), بند
 * 20 (Meeting Notes + Action Items), بند 21 (Polls). All three fetch
 * their initial snapshot alongside roster/chat in `setup()` below, then
 * stay live off the same presence channel (no extra subscription, same
 * pattern as every Round 5/6 addition). Notes body edits and every
 * action-item/poll write are `isManager`-gated client-side exactly like
 * `myRole`/`isManager` above — MeetingNotesService/MeetingPollService
 * re-check on the backend regardless, these are UI affordances only.
 * Voting and file sharing themselves are open to any actor present
 * (including a guest) — only *creating/closing* a poll, *editing* notes/
 * action items, and *deleting someone else's file* are manager-gated.
 *
 * Round 9 (Recording) addition — بند 18. "Client-side recording as a
 * practical temporary solution (without SFU)" (see
 * MeetingRecordingService's own docblock): there is no media server
 * compositing anything, so *this browser* — specifically, whichever
 * manager's browser called `startRecording()` — renders every visible
 * tile onto a hidden `<canvas>` (mirroring MeetingRoomShell's own grid,
 * redrawn every animation frame off the *live* `participants`/
 * `localStream` state so newly-joined participants appear without
 * restarting anything) and mixes every stream's audio through a Web
 * Audio graph, `canvas.captureStream()` + the mixed audio track feed a
 * single `MediaRecorder`. Start/stop of the *server-side row*
 * (recordingsApi.start/stop, who may see the "Recording" indicator,
 * status transitions) is real-time for everyone via the presence
 * channel exactly like files/notes/polls above — but the recorded
 * bytes only ever exist in the browser that's actually running the
 * MediaRecorder, so `stopRecordingLocal()` (the one that uploads the
 * finished Blob) only ever makes sense from that same browser
 * (`isRecordingLocally`) — a *different* co-host sees the "Recording…"
 * indicator like everyone else but has no local Blob to stop with, so
 * RecordingsPanel doesn't offer them a stop button (see its own
 * docblock).
